It is home to an estimated 10 percent of all species on the planet, including over 40,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, and more than 3,000 types of fish. The forest plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. However, deforestation driven by agriculture, logging, and mining has led to the loss of approximately 17 percent of the forest cover in the last 50 years. Scientists warn that continued destruction could push the ecosystem past a tipping point, transforming large areas into savanna and releasing billions of tons of stored carbon into the atmosphere.",

Research shows that adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night for optimal health. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, clears toxic waste products, and repairs neural connections. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to increased risks of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and weakened immune function. Furthermore, studies have shown that even moderate sleep loss can impair cognitive performance, reaction times, and emotional regulation to a degree comparable to alcohol intoxication. Despite this evidence, surveys indicate that over one-third of adults regularly get less than the recommended amount of sleep.",
